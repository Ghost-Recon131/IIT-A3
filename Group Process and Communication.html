        <div class="detail_content">The communication aspect of the group was identified by every member to be crucial to our success in our assignment. Great communication between members of the group would allow every member to be always on the same page, it is important because poor communication can lead to mismanagement, and hence lead to bad results (Markovic, Salamzadeh, 2018)
The communications between the group was the first part of our group discussion, with most of the communication talking about the availability of all members for group meetings. The plan is to try and do as many meetings as possible as the group has decided to work on some of the design aspects as a pair or more rather than those working on the same part doing so individually.  We have also decided to relay all work done to all members of the group once done which ensures that all members are on the same page at once.

An issue that our group identified was the issue of a member not being available or not being able to attend, and we came with a solution of letting that member know what the group achieved and all the details about the next meeting to ensure that, that member is able to keep on track and does not get left behind.
We are aiming to have 2 meetings a week, but we have another plan if that doesn’t occur which involves firstly texting a reticule which works for every member to keep working and continue to text changes or new things that were added to the assignment.
