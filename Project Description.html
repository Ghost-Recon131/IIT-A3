            This project will propose the use of AI models and machine learning to boost cybersecurity defence for an
            organisation.
            By using all endpoints (individual computers / devices for each employee), server usage data and running
            alongside applications, the AI model will have far more data to work with compared to current antivirus or
            business security solutions. Thus, will help circumvent with attacks that rely on compromised accounts or
            zero-day attacks in addition to the usual malware attacks. The necessary hardware is already available,
            currently
            ‘only’ an AI model and time is needed. There is also a demand for using AI to enhance cybersecurity, thus
            making this product profitable once all technical details are worked out and a fully developed product is
            ready to hit the market.

            According to a study by Stanford University, “88% data breach incidents are caused by employees’ mistakes”
            (CISOMAG, 2020). As human error is the primary cause of cybersecurity incidents, there is a market for more
            advanced cybersecurity software beyond the usual email, links and virus scans most existing solutions offer.
            In a separate study by IBM, human error is the main cause of 95% of cyber security breaches. In other words,
            if human error was somehow eliminated entirely, 19 out of 20 cyber breaches may not have taken place (Micke
            Ahola, 2019).
            <br></br>
            Another aspect is improving Protection against 0-day attacks. As documented in Google’s report (Maddie Stone
            and Clement Lecigne, 2021), there has been a consistent uptick in 0-Day vulnerabilities detected following
            2018.
            Furthermore “Estimates indicate that the market for AI in cybersecurity will grow from US $1billion in 2016
            to a US $34.8 billion net worth by 2025” (Taddeo, McCutcheon and Floridi, 2019), thus making this a
            financially
            viable investment.
            <br></br>
            Working on this project is also a good way to advertise oneself for future employers. The skill requirement
            for this project to be successful is high, requiring a deep understanding in Software Development,
            Cybersecurity,
            Data Science + Machine Learning and Cloud Architecture Design. Thus, it would be a good way to show that you
            are
            highly experienced in one of these areas.

            I originally choose this topic since I would like to work in the field of Cybersecurity after graduating
            from Uni, and the number of zero-day vulnerabilities being found or exploited is ever-increasing. This
            project would attempt to speed up the detection of exploits and prevent IT systems from being breached
            because
            of these previously unknown attack vectors or from intentional or unintentional damage caused by staff
            members.

            Cybersecurity was the general job position I wanted to work in, as there were some interesting aspects in
            terms
            of how a system can be breached, and what can happen as a result. With this project, I would be able to get
            a
            glimpse of how some things work to survey and protect devices, and what it may look like in a realistic
            situation.
            With the use and accessibility of technology expanding each year, more technology can be at risk of breaches
            in many ways, so working on programs like these are a start to the prevention of cyber-attacks and can act
            as
            proof of my knowledge on Cybersecurity and related information.

            Our main competitor will be existing companies that offer a similar IDPS system, such as providers from
            CISCO’s Secure IPS (NGIPS) (Cisco, 2022), Fireye’s Network Security and Forensics (FireEye, 2022),
            Paloaltonetworks’ enterprise IPS (paloaltonetworks, 2022) and Dartrace’ Enterprise Immune System (darktrace,
            2022) etc.

            While some of the offered product’s state that they use AI in their products, our solution offers a system
            where
            further fine tuning can be done. This is done by training a specialised ML model for the customer based off
            devices on their network. Which is beneficial to anomaly detection, as a generalised model likely need to be
            less sensitive to avoid constant false positives. Another selling point is an external SDK which can be
            integrated
            into existing software. So far there some of the previously mentioned companies offer protection for
            cloud-based
            infrastructure but not at a software level. This can be used by developers to protect their programs and
            data
            from 0-day attacks, rather than just their hardware and infrastructure.

            <br></br>
            "The global Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) market is anticipated to rise at a
            considerable
            rate during the forecast period, between 2022 and 2028" and "The global Intrusion Detection and Prevention
            Systems (IDPS) market size is projected to reach USD 7023.2 million by 2028, from USD 5053.1 million in
            2021,
            at a CAGR of 4.7% during 2022-2028." (marketwatch, 2022).

            <br></br>
            From this data, we can see that the demand for IDPS is expanding and thus, we will need to worry about
            entering
            a stale or declining market. The target audience for this project are large organisations, companies,
            schools,
            and government agencies. These groups have many endpoints and helps to further enhance our project as
            predictions will be more accurate with more data to train the ML model. These groups are also far more
            likely
            to spend money on advanced IDPS systems. This can be operated as SaaS where the customer sources their own
            hardware or IaaS where they choose to depend on our infrastructure as well as the software.

            We see this project as being split into three parts. The first part involves overall research of the topic,
            from competing services, possible features, required components and manpower as well as tools required and
            deployment. Our second part will focus on designing parts of the program, so that we have a few proof-of-concept
            type software ready or functional prototypes for further testing and evaluation. During this stage, we will
            try to improve any originally planned features or make changes on the initial plan if a task no longer seems
            possible. The final part will include programming all the planned features through multiple Sprints, using the
            Agile development model and Scrum process. Following this final part, we aim to have a working product ready
            for beta testing in the real world.

            <br></br>
            Currently, we are in Part 2 of the Project. We are working on the creation of high-fidelity wireframes which
            every member of the group did together. We used lucid chart to create these mock-ups, this was to get a start
            and to gain an understanding of what our actual creation would look like. Once this was completed, we as a
            group decided to split up the portions of the report, so every member had a section to work on. We also discussed
            our next meetings and the frequency of these meetings we would be able to be consistent with as a collective.
            Our member Daniel had worked with Figma before, so he was allocated to work on making our mock-ups functional
            via the use of Figma and its tools, Phoebe was also interested in designing and creating our product, so she
            was also allocated to work on it. Praniv and Danny were allocated to work on the A3 website and their parts
            on the report and both also were more than happy to lend a hand on Figma if it was needed. A Trello board is
            also setup to keep track of work that needs to be done, is in progress and what has been completed.

        <div class="detail_subtitle">Group Website</div>
        <div class="detail_content">
            In relation to our GitHub website Praniv worked on it and used our assignment 2 website's template due to the
            group's satisfaction with the layout and look of it. The main components that need to be added were not much,
            as most of the work consisted of cleaning up the sections that were not need for assignment 3, adding in the
            relevant html files that were in this project and ensuring that it was also added in areas of code where it
            was linked and or referenced. For example, each html had to be put in our home/ team profile page and in our
            header code to users could quickly access all our sections. The rest was the formatting of each portion in
            terms of the titles, subheading and the content that would need to be transferred in, getting this set would
            early before the completion of the report was the plan as it would make it easy to copy and paste the relevant
            sections quickly into the correct areas. Henry also reviewed the work done and was able to pick up on some
            improvements that could be done and added missing codes and improved upon the codes to ensure efficiency and
            effectiveness of the code.

        <div class="detail_subtitle">Figma Prototype</div>
        <div class="detail_content">
            Daniel had learned of Figma at the start of the course and had to learn its usage for other assignments.
            Daniel had used software such as Inkscape during College, giving him a general knowledge on certain art-related
            shortcuts and uses, which fortunately assisted him in the use of Figma. Before working on the prototype of the
            program, to test what was available, he made one “frame” that consisted of him messing around with different
            tools, such as making a slider with two circle tools and a rectangle. After learning what basic tools were
            available, Daniel put text on each section to make a frame that was like a “tutorial” for members that were
            not familiar with Figma or other related software. Using the LucidChart wireframes as a basis, Daniel decided
            to use a 1920x1080 frame to simulate the size of a window, and a general grey background as its base.

            <br></br>
            At first, Daniel designed the frames to use a bit of the space to recreate the title bar, consisting of a
            close and minimise button, but upon viewing other artefacts made by other members, decided to use all of the
            1920x1080 space for the design itself. Instead of using the Rectangle tool to create the boxes, Daniel used
            the Pen tool to create rounded edges, which also allowed him to freely stretch the shape into different sized
            shapes with ease. As he got to the wireframes with icons, he noticed the icons themselves were stock images,
            or random images from the internet. With his knowledge of Inkscape, Daniel decided to recreate each icon in
            Inkscape, tracing the icons while also making their own small changes to create an original icon. Once made,
            Daniel was unsure how to scale the icons equally, so he bordered one of the enlarged icons, then used that
            border as a format for the rest of the icons. Although it took a little longer due to slight unfamiliarity,
            Daniel decided to make each icon transparent instead of a white background, as the white background would
            look weird against the grey background. A separate frame was made, called “Etc.”, where all the icons were
            placed, then used as local components for quick reference. To get an idea of what the exact positions of the
            buttons and text involved in the wireframe were placed, Daniel took a cropped screenshot of the chosen wireframe
            window and resized it to match the 1920x1080 frames. But when he scaled them up, the size of the windows did
            not match the 1920x1080 frame, meaning the design would stretch in order to fit the wireframe. Instead,
            Daniel decided to centre each cropped image, turn their opacity down, then place buttons and text as to how
            he would think they would look on the bigger frame.

            <br></br>
            When it came to text, Daniel decided on a mix of Calibri and Fira Sans, as they were popular typefaces that
            are easy to read, using a mix of bold, semi bold and normal fonts throughout the design. At first Daniel
            thought this was all he could do on Figma, but then he learned about the “Prototype” feature available on
            Figma. With no idea how prototypes worked, Daniel spent a few days understanding how it worked, and decided
            to put Flows for the Admin, WebApp and Endpoint sections of the design.
