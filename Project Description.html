            This project will propose the use of AI models and machine learning to boost cybersecurity defence for an
            organisation.
            By using all endpoints (individual computers / devices for each employee), server usage data and running
            alongside applications, the AI model will have far more data to work with compared to current antivirus or
            business security solutions. Thus, will help circumvent with attacks that rely on compromised accounts or
            zero-day attacks in addition to the usual malware attacks. The necessary hardware is already available,
            currently
            ‘only’ an AI model and time is needed. There is also a demand for using AI to enhance cybersecurity, thus
            making this product profitable once all technical details are worked out and a fully developed product is
            ready to hit the market.

            According to a study by Stanford University, “88% data breach incidents are caused by employees’ mistakes”
            (CISOMAG, 2020). As human error is the primary cause of cybersecurity incidents, there is a market for more
            advanced cybersecurity software beyond the usual email, links and virus scans most existing solutions offer.
            In a separate study by IBM, human error is the main cause of 95% of cyber security breaches. In other words,
            if human error was somehow eliminated entirely, 19 out of 20 cyber breaches may not have taken place (Micke
            Ahola, 2019).
            <br></br>
            Another aspect is improving Protection against 0-day attacks. As documented in Google’s report (Maddie Stone
            and Clement Lecigne, 2021), there has been a consistent uptick in 0-Day vulnerabilities detected following
            2018.
            Furthermore “Estimates indicate that the market for AI in cybersecurity will grow from US $1billion in 2016
            to a US $34.8 billion net worth by 2025” (Taddeo, McCutcheon and Floridi, 2019), thus making this a
            financially
            viable investment.
            <br></br>
            Working on this project is also a good way to advertise oneself for future employers. The skill requirement
            for this project to be successful is high, requiring a deep understanding in Software Development,
            Cybersecurity,
            Data Science + Machine Learning and Cloud Architecture Design. Thus, it would be a good way to show that you
            are
            highly experienced in one of these areas.

            I do not have an interest to work in the cybersecurity field and before our assignment 2 where we first did
            our Project, I did not know much about it. Throughout this assignment I have learnt about cyber security
            more and I do mind it a very interesting and important area, especially our project idea in which we ensure
            systems don’t get breached hence increasing safety and security for users. It is clearly very important as
            it protects all areas and categories from theft and malware/ damage which is crucial in the digital world we
            live in today.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2"> Jingxuan</div>
            I originally choose this topic since I would like to work in the field of Cybersecurity after graduating
            from Uni, and the number of zero-day vulnerabilities being found or exploited is ever-increasing. This
            project would attempt to speed up the detection of exploits and prevent IT systems from being breached
            because
            of these previously unknown attack vectors or from intentional or unintentional damage caused by staff
            members.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2"> Yuxuan</div>
            Although I have no intention of working in the field of cyber security, this project is still very
            interesting to me because in the future I would like to work in a field related to computers, and cyber
            security is an issue that has been around since the beginning of computers, and this project will allow me
            to learn in advance what it is like when computer systems are damaged, and how to protect them.

            Cybersecurity was the general job position I wanted to work in, as there were some interesting aspects in
            terms
            of how a system can be breached, and what can happen as a result. With this project, I would be able to get
            a
            glimpse of how some things work to survey and protect devices, and what it may look like in a realistic
            situation.
            With the use and accessibility of technology expanding each year, more technology can be at risk of breaches
            in many ways, so working on programs like these are a start to the prevention of cyber-attacks and can act
            as
            proof of my knowledge on Cybersecurity and related information.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2"> Danny</div>
            I had no particular interest when it came to working within the cybersecurity field. However, over the years
            I had seen a multitude of different companies and websites hit by data breaches, leaking, or stealing
            people’s information. While I might not have an interest in working in this field, I think that there is a
            lot you could learn from this project to at least develop a basic understanding of why cybersecurity is such
            an integral part of everyday technology and the importance of staying vigilant when it comes to one's own
            personal information.

            Our main competitor will be existing companies that offer a similar IDPS system, such as providers from
            CISCO’s Secure IPS (NGIPS) (Cisco, 2022), Fireye’s Network Security and Forensics (FireEye, 2022),
            Paloaltonetworks’ enterprise IPS (paloaltonetworks, 2022) and Dartrace’ Enterprise Immune System (darktrace,
            2022) etc.

            While some of the offered product’s state that they use AI in their products, our solution offers a system
            where
            further fine tuning can be done. This is done by training a specialised ML model for the customer based off
            devices on their network. Which is beneficial to anomaly detection, as a generalised model likely need to be
            less sensitive to avoid constant false positives. Another selling point is an external SDK which can be
            integrated
            into existing software. So far there some of the previously mentioned companies offer protection for
            cloud-based
            infrastructure but not at a software level. This can be used by developers to protect their programs and
            data
            from 0-day attacks, rather than just their hardware and infrastructure.

            <br></br>
            "The global Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) market is anticipated to rise at a
            considerable
            rate during the forecast period, between 2022 and 2028" and "The global Intrusion Detection and Prevention
            Systems (IDPS) market size is projected to reach USD 7023.2 million by 2028, from USD 5053.1 million in
            2021,
            at a CAGR of 4.7% during 2022-2028." (marketwatch, 2022).

            <br></br>
            From this data, we can see that the demand for IDPS is expanding and thus, we will need to worry about
            entering
            a stale or declining market. The target audience for this project are large organisations, companies,
            schools,
            and government agencies. These groups have many endpoints and helps to further enhance our project as
            predictions will be more accurate with more data to train the ML model. These groups are also far more
            likely
            to spend money on advanced IDPS systems. This can be operated as SaaS where the customer sources their own
            hardware or IaaS where they choose to depend on our infrastructure as well as the software.

            We see this project as being split into three parts. The first part involves overall research of the topic,
            from competing services, possible features, required components and manpower as well as tools required and
            deployment. Our second part will focus on designing parts of the program, so that we have a few proof-of-concept
            type software ready or functional prototypes for further testing and evaluation. During this stage, we will
            try to improve any originally planned features or make changes on the initial plan if a task no longer seems
            possible. The final part will include programming all the planned features through multiple Sprints, using the
            Agile development model and Scrum process. Following this final part, we aim to have a working product ready
            for beta testing in the real world.

            <br></br>
            Currently, we are in Part 2 of the Project. We are working on the creation of high-fidelity wireframes which
            every member of the group did together. We used lucid chart to create these mock-ups, this was to get a start
            and to gain an understanding of what our actual creation would look like. Once this was completed, we as a
            group decided to split up the portions of the report, so every member had a section to work on. We also discussed
            our next meetings and the frequency of these meetings we would be able to be consistent with as a collective.
            Our member Daniel had worked with Figma before, so he was allocated to work on making our mock-ups functional
            via the use of Figma and its tools, Phoebe was also interested in designing and creating our product, so she
            was also allocated to work on it. Praniv and Danny were allocated to work on the A3 website and their parts
            on the report and both also were more than happy to lend a hand on Figma if it was needed. A Trello board is
            also setup to keep track of work that needs to be done, is in progress and what has been completed.

        <div class="detail_subtitle">Group Website</div>
        <div class="detail_content">
            In relation to our GitHub website Praniv worked on it and used our assignment 2 website's template due to the
            group's satisfaction with the layout and look of it. The main components that need to be added were not much,
            as most of the work consisted of cleaning up the sections that were not need for assignment 3, adding in the
            relevant html files that were in this project and ensuring that it was also added in areas of code where it
            was linked and or referenced. For example, each html had to be put in our home/ team profile page and in our
            header code to users could quickly access all our sections. The rest was the formatting of each portion in
            terms of the titles, subheading and the content that would need to be transferred in, getting this set would
            early before the completion of the report was the plan as it would make it easy to copy and paste the relevant
            sections quickly into the correct areas. Henry also reviewed the work done and was able to pick up on some
            improvements that could be done and added missing codes and improved upon the codes to ensure efficiency and
            effectiveness of the code.

        <div class="detail_subtitle">Figma Prototype</div>
        <div class="detail_content">
            Daniel had learned of Figma at the start of the course and had to learn its usage for other assignments.
            Daniel had used software such as Inkscape during College, giving him a general knowledge on certain art-related
            shortcuts and uses, which fortunately assisted him in the use of Figma. Before working on the prototype of the
            program, to test what was available, he made one “frame” that consisted of him messing around with different
            tools, such as making a slider with two circle tools and a rectangle. After learning what basic tools were
            available, Daniel put text on each section to make a frame that was like a “tutorial” for members that were
            not familiar with Figma or other related software. Using the LucidChart wireframes as a basis, Daniel decided
            to use a 1920x1080 frame to simulate the size of a window, and a general grey background as its base.

            <br></br>
            At first, Daniel designed the frames to use a bit of the space to recreate the title bar, consisting of a
            close and minimise button, but upon viewing other artefacts made by other members, decided to use all of the
            1920x1080 space for the design itself. Instead of using the Rectangle tool to create the boxes, Daniel used
            the Pen tool to create rounded edges, which also allowed him to freely stretch the shape into different sized
            shapes with ease. As he got to the wireframes with icons, he noticed the icons themselves were stock images,
            or random images from the internet. With his knowledge of Inkscape, Daniel decided to recreate each icon in
            Inkscape, tracing the icons while also making their own small changes to create an original icon. Once made,
            Daniel was unsure how to scale the icons equally, so he bordered one of the enlarged icons, then used that
            border as a format for the rest of the icons. Although it took a little longer due to slight unfamiliarity,
            Daniel decided to make each icon transparent instead of a white background, as the white background would
            look weird against the grey background. A separate frame was made, called “Etc.”, where all the icons were
            placed, then used as local components for quick reference. To get an idea of what the exact positions of the
            buttons and text involved in the wireframe were placed, Daniel took a cropped screenshot of the chosen wireframe
            window and resized it to match the 1920x1080 frames. But when he scaled them up, the size of the windows did
            not match the 1920x1080 frame, meaning the design would stretch in order to fit the wireframe. Instead,
            Daniel decided to centre each cropped image, turn their opacity down, then place buttons and text as to how
            he would think they would look on the bigger frame.

            <br></br>
            When it came to text, Daniel decided on a mix of Calibri and Fira Sans, as they were popular typefaces that
            are easy to read, using a mix of bold, semi bold and normal fonts throughout the design. At first Daniel
            thought this was all he could do on Figma, but then he learned about the “Prototype” feature available on
            Figma. With no idea how prototypes worked, Daniel spent a few days understanding how it worked, and decided
            to put Flows for the Admin, WebApp and Endpoint sections of the design. After a few mistakes with reusing the same links between icons and where some flows would be directed, the prototype was successfully created.

        <div class="detail_content">
            <br></br>
            Following Figma prototypes, we aim to work on 2-3 other proof-of-concept software. These are the Admin Control
            Panel software, ML Web Control Panel webapp and possibly a Backend for the ML Webapp. These designs will be
            based upon our Wireframes and Figma prototype, with some functional features mentioned earlier in the Aims section.
        </div>


        <div class="detail_subtitle">Admin Control Panel Software (JavaFx + Spring Boot)</div>
        <div class="detail_content">
            Originally, we planned to use JavaFx with Maven as the dependency manager to create the software. However,
            we realised that that involves writing 300-400 lines of code dedicated to CRUD (Create / Read / Update / Delete)
            operations for using a database for persistent storage. Where the database is used to store account logins,
            notifications, and log files. This resulted in a lot of work with little to show for in terms of functionality
            and design when an end user looks at our program. It would also mean that if we needed to update the data
            structures in the future, a lot of refactoring will need to be done on our DAO’s (Data Access Objects) for CRUD tasks.

            <br></br>
            At this point, we decided to switch to using Spring Boot to speed up development. Originally it is designed
            to create webapp Backends or microservices (IBM Cloud Education, 2020) but it can speedup our data handling
            process. In our data class for example Accounts.java, we can annotate it with @Entity, then combine that with
            a repository interface i.e., AccountsRepository.java then extend JPARepository and annotate the class with
            @Repository. By performing these steps, Spring Boot will automatically create a table inside a defined SQL
            Database then have a column for every data variable we have inside the Account class. JPARepository allows
            for easy CRUD operations as we only need to define methods and its parameters, without having to write the
            code to search for the data ourselves. This meant that the bulk of the development effort can now be focused
            on developing the planned features and the user interface, rather than spending time on Data Wrangling.

            <br></br>
            To create each of the scenes, we use SceneBuilder, a GUI that allows for quick drag and drop placements of
            JavaFx elements, like text, textfields and buttons. We can then assign FX:ID to manipulate an element within
            the code or have a button or icon execute code when and it is clicked on.

            <br></br>
            Initially when developing this software, I used a local MySQL database then I moved it to a RDS instance hosted
            on AWS. However, the performance was terrible, now each time the database needs to be accessed, there is a
            noticeable 2-3 second delay where the program appears to free up, when it is just waiting for data to finish
            transferring from the database. To solve this problem, I rechecked the available instance types on AWS, and
            it turns out AWS Sydney servers had free tier RDS instances added sometime after I initially setup the RDS
            instance in US-EAST-1 region, as when I initially checked the Australian region didn’t offer free tier RDS service.

            <br></br>
            After moving to a Sydney based server and on a higher performance db.t4g.micro instance, compared to the original
            t2.micro instance. The t4 instance appears to be a new addition to AWS free tier and has 2 VCPU’s and 1GB of ram.
            Closer server also meant less ping and the combination of the two changes mean that currently there is around
            a 200-300ms delay when performing database CRUD operations. While not as good as localhost performance,
            it is much better than before.

            <br></br>
            Below is the current data flow:

        <div class="detail_subtitle">ML Web App (React Frontend) </div>
        <div class="detail_content">
            This Web App artifact is chosen to be done using React it is a good learning opportunity and gives access to
            lots of nodeJs libraries which can reduce amount of coding needed. Currently, the Frontend is more of a prototype
            and a basis to start future development work. It is mainly used to familiarise ourselves with Javascript and
            Cloud Deployment. When all the pages on the webapp is finished, then we will deploy it onto AWS to simulate
            real development.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2"> Docker, ECR and ECS deployment </div>
            Normally for a simple frontend deployment, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk would be the easiest way to do so.
            As we can directly upload a .zip of our code and it will handle provisioning the needed resources, such as
            EC2 instance, Storage and networking. However, this did not work for me in the past and I kept getting Error
            500’s and service degraded, despite the code running perfectly fine on localhost.

            <br></br>
            This time, I decided to avoid any potential problems by Dockerising the React frontend. By using Docker, we
            can also reduce any “environment sensitive” bugs and issues, where a bug may occur on one setup but not
            another. Thus, if the Docker image runs locally, then it should work the same when used on a different
            machine. To Dockerise our program, we need to install Docker, which requires setting up WSL/WSL2 on windows
            or natively on Linux and MacOS. After that is done, a DockerFile is needed before we can run the docker
            build command to create our Docker Image. Once the image is created, we will push it to a repository setup
            in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). This process is a bit like using git push. From there, we create
            a Cluster in Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS). By creating the cluster, we define some details such as
            the network settings, type of EC2 instance to use and how many instances to deploy. ECS is easier than
            manually setting up a EC2 instance as it can deploy Docker Images directly to a EC2 instance, rather than
            manually SSH into an EC2 instance, setup all the needed software, then manually start the Docker Image.

            <br></br>
            After the cluster is created, we need to make a Task Definition, which includes which docker image to run,
            RAM and CPU limit settings. Following this process, we can go back to our ECS cluster, then run our created
            task. This will then start the Docker Image in the EC2 instance within a minute or two. To update our code,
            we will need to recreate the Docker image on our machine, push it to ECR again, stop the running task on ECS
            and re-run the task. This will deploy our updated Docker image. At this point, we can customise the Security
            Group settings to allow external traffic, then use the Public IPv4 DNS to connect to our EC2 instance, such
            as using:
            http:// ec2-somename.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000.

            <br></br>
            The image below shows the deployment diagram from code to deployment to EC2 instance:
            <img src="images/Deployment AWS Architecture Diagram.png" alt="Docker Deployment process" width="811" height="367">


            <div class="detail_subtitle2"> Domain Hosting & HTTPS</div>
            As this project idea is a cybersecurity-based project, it would be quite ironic if we just had non-encrypted
            http traffic going to our Frontend, especially if this is to be used in the future. Thus, we will secure
            this website with HTTPS.

            <br></br>
            To achieve this, I have setup an Application Load Balancer, with listeners on port 80 for http and port 443
            for https. On the https listener, I need to attach a certificate, which I will do using Amazon Certificate
            Manager (ACM). In ACM, we need a domain name to the certificate, here I added
            “reactfrontend.s3843790-cc.com”, then I will need to verify the certificate by adding CNAME values to my
            Domain. As I have a domain from Route53, I can add the necessary values directly by ticking the values and
            click add, without going to my Domain management panel.

            <br></br>
            After the certificate is setup, I will need to setup a target group, this is used to tell the Application
            Load Balancer which EC2 instance to redirect the traffic to, I will also configure the network port to
            redirect traffic to, as the Docker image is exposed on port 3000, I will need to use port 3000 here. Now the
            Application Load Balancer will redirect all network traffic to port 3000 on my specified EC2 instance.

            <br></br>
            To finish using the registered domain to visit the website, I will need to head to Route53 Hosted Zone menu,
            then to my Domain, then create Record. The record type will be type A and subdomain is “reactfrontend”, this
            here needs to match what I entered before to create the SSL certificate. After that I click on the ‘alias’
            toggle, pick ‘Alias to Application and Classic Load balancer’ then ap-southeast-2 (Sydney) as the region,
            then the Application load balancer I created for my EC2 instance. Finally, we can create the record and wait
            a few minutes for the changes to apply. This then completes HTTPS setup, and we can visit the web frontend
            with encrypted traffic.

            <br></br>
            Below shows the traffic flow from the user to visiting the cloud resources:
            <img src="images/Actual AWS Architecture Diagram.png" alt="Traffic flow from user to hosted website"
                 width="827" height="338">

            <div class="detail_subtitle2"> ML Web App (Spring Boot Backend)</div>
            This final artifact is something we will work on if we have additional time. This will be a backend also
            written in Spring Boot but used properly as a website backend this time. It will handle all the program
            logic and receiving / saving or getting data for the frontend. To simplify deployment, this can be deployed
            as a separate Docker image onto the same Cluster and T2 instance as the website frontend.

            <br></br>
            For the Frontend to communicate with the Backend, we will use RESTful endpoints in the Backend, such as
            http://localhost:8080/api/accounts/login
            The Frontend will then make the relevant request such as POST / GET / PUT / DELETE. This can be done
            natively in Javascript but we will prefer to use the Axios library as it makes the code neater and is
            slightly easier to organise the data.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2"> Continuous Integration / Deployment (CI / CD)</div>
            This final artifact is using Circle CI as well as CodePipeline as our CI / CD workflow. For the Admin
            software, Circle CI servers to automate the testing and build process. The process will begin by pushing
            into branch ‘Master’, CircleCI will notice the new commit then run all the unit tests in the project. Once
            all tests pass, it will try to build the .jar file. However, this did not work, as there were no Oracle Java
            SDK’s available. At this point, I tried including another image for JavaFx, however this also didn’t work.
            Thus, it seems it is not possible to get CI / CD working for now unless we created our own Docker image of
            an Oracle Java 8 SDK.

            <br></br>
            CircleCI was also added for the ML Webapp, this was successful as all it does at the moment is try to
            compile the frontend. In the future, test cases for the frontend can be written and Circle CI can then use
            those for automated testing.


            <div class="detail_subtitle3"> AWS CodePipeline</div>
            I’ve setup a Pipeline on AWS so that every time commits are pushed into Master branch for our ML Webapp
            repository, it will fetch the changes then build the Docker Image on AWS. Following that, it will
            automatically tag and push the Docker Image to my ECR then deploy to my ECS cluster and replace the
            previously running task. This process takes around 4-6 minutes and is faster and easier than the previously
            mentioned manual process.

            <br></br>

            Circle CI will be used to perform automatic testing and builds once commits are pushed into the ‘Master’
            branch for both the admin software and ML Web app.

            <br></br>
            CodePipeline is used to speed up the AWS deployment process, by creating the Docker image in the cloud and
            then automatically pushing it to my ECR, then deploying it to a running ECS cluster. This removes the need
            to manually Dockerise the frontend, push to ECR then restarting the running task. This whole process can
            take upwards of 4-6 minutes.

            In this section, we will continue with proposed Cloud Solution made in assignment 2.
            <br></br>

            Using EC2 instances, it gives us more control over how to deploy the servers and control what services will
            be installed in them. The drawback is needing to configure the cloud infrastructure and pay as soon as the
            EC2 instances start, rather than time spent training the ML model. EKS deployment also gives us control of
            "load balancing or autoscaling" (Gallatin, 2021). This also requires the cloud engineers and data scientist
            to work together to manage the Kubernetes cluster. ECS removes "some lower-level infrastructure concerns"
            (Gallatin, 2021), while maintaining flexibility. It offers a good balance between customisation and ease of
            deployment, which can help to reduce development and future ongoing costs.

        <div class="detail_content">
            <div class="detail_subtitle2">Spring Boot</div>
            Most team members are new to this framework, as most members have not had Web programming experience. This
            was used to speed up the Admin Software artifact but is designed to be used as the Backend for websites and
            webapps.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2">Java & JavaFx</div>
            Jingxuan was responsible for creating the Admin Webapp as he has prior experience with both the language and
            frameworks used. Other group members have not used Java & JavaFx before.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2">AWS Services & Management Console</div>
            Jingxuan is the only group member with prior experience with AWS services and will handle deployment and AWS
            hosting for our artifacts.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2">React</div>
            Our team is mostly unfamiliar with the React library and JavaScript in general. We see this as a way to
            experiment and learn something new.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2">Circle CI & AWS Code Pipeline</div>
            Jingxuan will create the necessary .yml files and setup for CI / CD. Other group members are not familiar in
            Dev-Ops related tasks and have not used these two tools before.

        <div class="detail_content">
            For Figma prototypes, we will perform manual testing. A group member will walk through all scenarios and
            make sure everything is behaving as expected. We will also ask a few friends to try to use the Figma prototype
            and see whether our interface design is user-friendly. This testing is simple so only a single group member
            is needed.

            <br></br>
            The prototype will be considered done once
            <ol>
                <li> Link take the user to the correct scene</li>
                <li> Design follows Wireframe design, and nothing has been missed</li>

        <div class="detail_content">
            The admin software will be tested manually by team members using the following GWT criterion. This section
            will involve testing by three team members, as we also want to test that the software works correctly when
            multiple users are logged in at the same time.
            Background needed: Java must be installed prior to testing and tester has working internet connection.

            <br></br>
            Their main goal is to test that
            <ol>
                <li> Buttons do what they are planned to do (ie go to next page, show text)</li>
                <li> All user input is validated, and no input can crash the program</li>
                <li> Program does not and exit to desktop based on user interaction or user input</li>

        <div class="detail_content">
            <div class="detail_subtitle2"> Feature: Account Registration</div>
            Given: that I am a new administrator working at the company. And I would like to access the admin control
            software
            <br></br>
            When: I open the software and left click on the “Register” button.
            <br></br>
            Then: I fill in the require details, I will be able to return to the Login page by left clicking on the
            “Back” button.
            <br></br>
            Testing Result: Passed, errors shown when required fields are not entered or not entered correctly.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2"> Feature: Login (Incorrect credentials)</div>
            Given: that want to log into the admin software.
            <br></br>
            When: I enter the incorrect username and/or password and left click on “Login”
            <br></br>
            Then: I receive an error message stating that my credentials are incorrect. And the software stays on the
            login page.
            <br></br>
            Testing Result: Passed, correctly shows prompt when account does not exist, or incorrect details are
            entered.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2"> Feature: Login (Success)</div>
            Given: that I have an account in the admin software system. And my account is not disabled.
            <br></br>
            When: I enter my account credentials correctly and left click on “Login”
            <br></br>
            Then: I am taken to the Dashboard of the admin software.
            <br></br>
            Testing Result: Passed.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2"> Feature: Reset password</div>
            Given: that I have forgotten my password or want to change m password. And I have an account in the admin
            software.
            <br></br>
            When: I enter all the required details and left click on “Change Password”
            <br></br>
            Then: I am given a prompt that the login details have changed. And I will be able to return to the Login
            page by left clicking on the “Back” button. And I can now login with my new password.
            <br></br>
            Testing Result: Passed, errors will show if fields are not entered correctly or is an account doesn’t exist.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2"> Feature: View notifications</div>
            Given: I have logged into the admin software. And I left click on the “Notifications” button.
            <br></br>
            When: I click on the one of the notification ID’s on the left side bar underneath the “Notifications”
            heading.
            <br></br>
            Then: The central “Detailed View” panel shows the relevant information about the notification.
            <br></br>
            Testing Result: Passed, different details will show based on the notification.
            <br></br>
            Note: The displayed information is loaded from an RDS instance on AWS, due to this instance being on Free
            Tier, the performance is very slow. The software may appear to be frozen, but this is just the software
            waiting for the RDS instance to finish the data transfer.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2"> Feature: Mark notification as false positive</div>
            Given: that I am in the “View Notifications” page. And I have selected a notation to view
            <br></br>
            When: I left click on the “Mark as false positive” button.
            <br></br>
            Then: The notification is removed from the list of notifications.
            <br></br>
            Testing Result: Passed. Changes also saved so if 2 notifications were removed, it will remain that way in
            subsequent visits to the “View Notifications” page.
            <br></br>
            Note: When all 4 notifications are removed, 4 new notifications immediately get generated. This is a due to
            design implementation to always have some data to view and is not a system bug. The data is dummy data
            generated in a different Class in the source code.

            <div class="detail_subtitle2"> Feature: Download Log file</div>
            Given: I have logged into the admin software. And I left click on the “Logs” button.
            <br></br>
            When: I left click on the “Export Logs” button
            <br></br>
            Then: I am notified of the logs being saved. And the logs will be saved into a file called “FileOutput.csv”
            at the same directory as the executable file of the admin file.
            <br></br>
            Testing Result: Passed and CSV file contains the dummy data that can also be seen in the database.
            <br></br>
            Note: This feature also utilises RDS database, hence both opening this page and exporting the logs will feel
            slow.
