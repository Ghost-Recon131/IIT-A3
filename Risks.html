        <div class="detail_content">There are a few risks we will need to consider when developing and maintaining this program. Firstly, one risk is that not all team members are experienced in the software that will used to develop our program. Only 2 people in our development team have had sufficient experience with software such as Java/Java Fx, AWS, Spring Boot and React which means it will take some time training up other team members, which runs the risk of falling behind in development. Although not all team members need to know how to use this software it is beneficial to have majority of the team versed on it (If a team member leaves the project etc.)

 

As our system relies quite heavily on Artificial Intelligence there are a quite a few risks we will need to consider, one being that AI quite costly to maintain. We will need to consider potential breakdowns. If the program were to breakdown, not only would the cost for procurement be very high, the recovery will take quite some time also, which again increases the cost because you will need to pay employees to fix the system.

With AI we will also need to frequently update/upgrade the AI to ensure that it continues to cater for customer needs and doesn't become obsolete overtime. Lastly, AI can never replicate a human, meaning it does not know right from wrong, which introduces the risk of potential legal and ethical dilemmas.



Our design also leans heavily to utilising cloud infrastructure. In the case of a major AWS outage, we will be unable to control our ML models or deploy new models to our systems. Admins will also have to rely on a cached local database so no new accounts can be created.



Finally, another risk we will face is poor documentation. As we will be using an AI that will need to be constantly updated it means we may not be able to keep detailed and cohesive documentation which can again lead to issues with information retrieval and compliance to rules and regulations
