            <div class="detail_subtitle">Daniel</div>
            <div class="detail_content">Hey! I'm Daniel, and I'm a current 1st year student! I have a Vietnamese
                background, but have resided in Australia since
                birth. I have a general interest in the art, music and crafts people make, but most of all I am a fan of
                gaming,
                spending most of my days levelling up and progressing in various games, or experiencing the worlds and
                stories
                developers and creators have made. I think my enjoyment with IT would come from the creativity and
                versatility that IT
                is capable of. Being able to basically do anything with IT as long as you know the workings and options
                of a game engine
                or code seems cool to me. I have finished a "Partial Completion in Certificate III Information, Digital
                Media and
                Technology" VCE VET course during College, which was a great appetiser into the world of IT!</div>

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Phoebe</div>
            <div class="detail_content">My name is Phoebe, and I am currently undertaking my final year at university. I
                am Australian but my Grandparents are
                Polish. My general interests include playing video games and listening to music. I am an avid fan of The
                Sims 4 and can
                spend hours playing it and building in-game.</div>

            <div class="detail_content">
                My interest in It came about when I first started working at my current job, before then I was not even
                remotely
                interested. I currently work for a global payments provider and provide level 2 support for EFTPOS
                machines that belong
                clients such as NAB, McDonalds and CBA. Before working here, I was studying accounting so I switched
                into Business
                information Systems, and as the business information systems courses are not heavily IT focused, I
                thought it would be
                beneficial to study IT as my minor.
            </div>

            <div class="detail_content">
                At this very moment my IT knowledge is fairly limited to EFTPOS machines, POS systems and SQL Database
                Building/Structure but I have been able to expand on understanding of Sofware development/understanding
                while enrolled
                at RMIT.

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Praniv</div>
            <div class="detail_content">My name is Praniv Basnet, born in Nepal but I have been in Melbourne since I was
                6 years old. In terms of my academic
                studies, I have mainly been invested in business ever since high school, being awarded the dux in my
                year 12 graduation
                for the highest score out of my year level in business management. I love to play video games as they
                are fun and help
                me relax, and playing with friends is even better. I also played soccer in High School, but nowadays I
                mostly go to the
                gym and hang out with friends. I have recently been interested and started watching Mixed Martial Arts,
                especially the
                UFC. My interest in IT in my final semester was because I felt like marketing as a minor wouldnâ€™t do
                much for me, hence
                I choose IT because it is a skill which can be very useful, and there are many jobs relating to it. A
                lot of my friends
                also picked it, and whilst they mentioned it was a lot of work, they also told me it is a crucial skill
                highly in demand
                today. For me I also thought that it could help with my own business endeavours such as being able to
                create a website
                myself and learning how to code can lead into different business ideas. Prior to this semester, I had no
                real experience
                in IT other than the required classes taught back in high school.</div>

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Jingxuan</div>
            <div class="detail_content">I immigrated to Australia from China with my parents back in 2008, maintaining a
                conversational level of both Mandarin
                and Cantonese, which has come in handy multiple times such as in group work or helping international
                students.
            </div>
            <div class="detail_content">
                My primary interest in IT was in cybersecurity, however my interest started when the existing computer
                at home wasn't
                powerful enough to run my favourite games roughly back in 2014. I started looking at computer hardware,
                and further
                research got me interested in custom PC builds. Since then, I've had to deal with all the IT problems my
                parents have,
                getting me to set up anything with internet or smart home capabilities.

            <div class="detail_subtitle">Danny</div>
            <div class="detail_content">I have a Vietnamese background, and enjoy playing games. My main interest in
                studying IT is how flexible and diverse it
                is. IT always seemed to be a good baseline as it has a multitude of other routes to specialise in such
                as data analysis,
                cybersecurity, networking, software development, etc. I did not have an exact sort of course I wanted to
                focus on, and
                hope that by studying IT, I will still have a variety of options to choose from while I determine what I
                want to do.</div>

                China in Year 8 to study in Australia,
                and have lived in Australia for over four years. I love playing with my cats, talking to them, and
                having my ragdoll cat
                named Python lying on me for petting. I have always believed that Python is the best language in the
                world, and
                therefore, Python is the best cat in the world for me.</div>
            <div class="detail_content">An interest in IT came mostly from my family. My father is a programmer, and
                there are all kinds of programming books at
                home. However, MY interest in IT was that I could use my father's computer to play all sorts of games.
                When I was nine
                years old, I began to think about whether I could also make my own games. My father taught me Java in
                his free time.</div>
