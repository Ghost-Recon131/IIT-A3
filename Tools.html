                Firstly, our group prioritized getting all the work finalized before copying it over to the website.
                I first made the template for the whole website and after discussing it during our meeting, we gathered
                a lot of suggestions, such as using the multi-page and vertical side bars etc. Each member of the group
                was very conscientious, active, and organized in putting their own content on the website, which made the
                whole website go very smoothly. This can be seen in the GitHub commits, where at first there is little
                work, then as we get close to the due date and work is finalised, there is a lot of commits to the website.
                Meetings were generally used to check that all group members are working on their assigned sections and
                whether they have trouble completing the task. Reviews of work and discussions of any ideas will also take place.
