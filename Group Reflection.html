        By focusing and being allocated to areas that each member was more knowledgeable about, the project was able to
        progress without many hiccups,
        as members knew how to handle their sections. However, that also resulted in being less involved with other
        member’s prototypes, and how they function.
        Even in small amounts, perhaps explaining how the workings of a prototype were created or being involved in
        creating the prototype could increase the understanding of the project overall.

        With assignment 3 we focused on being the most efficient we could by firstly creating mock-ups together to
        ensure everyone was on the same page,
        after which we split up the tasks with different people or pairs of members working on prototypes and frames, so
        more can be done. While this made it
        faster to get work done and less time was wasted, as while some were working on their frames others would be
        working on a different frame or prototype,
        the downside was that some members may be confused due to members not being involved in other prototypes or
        knowing how others function, which could have
        resulted in a contradiction of our frames. We did have a lot better communication in this assignment though, a
        lot better than assignment 2, everyone was active in
        talking with each other and ensures other members knew when problems arise.

        In assignment 3, we’ve made creating the design wireframes or first task as a group, so that we all have a
        starting point to work off. After that, we split up remaining
        artifacts & reports into parts to ensure no one repeats the same task. The split up of work also allowed us to
        stay ahead despite illnesses or other factors effecting team member’s
        ability to work. During this assignment we also improved our communications, and always kept the team informed
        on our work & if we are having trouble. We could have improved by having a
        few more meetings to keep track of tasks better as well as get members more involved in artefacts.

        For assignment 3 we applied what we had done previously by allocating what sections each member would be working
        and focusing on. Creating the wireframes and mock-ups early on made it easier to understand what to do when it
        came to applying it with Lucidcharts and Figma. Compared to the previous assignment, our communication has
        improved as there were more meetings then previously. However, we could have had more meetings as communication
        was still lacking and certain section could have been better explained to other members who were not working on them.

        Compared to the last assignment 2 we did, our group understood what to do in a very quick time for this
        assignment. We actively assigned work and tried to use
        tools such as Lucidchart and Figma to get all the team members working together on a prototype or framework at
        the same time, demonstrating the coordination and cooperation between the team members.
        Unfortunately, I missed a few meetings during the completion of assignment 3 for personal reasons, however, to
        my surprise, the rest of the group still assigned work for me to help me get back to work and
        contribute my part after everything goes well.

        It was interesting to discover the different prototypes that were made for the project, as I have never heard of
        some of the sites or products used and found the e
        nd results to be equally or more advanced than other prototypes for the project.

        I learnt that many of our members have a background in different areas of IT already and was really surprised
        with how good they were with using apps like
        figma and lucid charts and coding to create another version of our prototype.

        It was surprising to see how many artifacts we have created over the course of this assignment. The original
        going into this A3 only covered half of the current completed artifacts. It was also great how team members were
        able to
        quickly learn new tools such as Figma & React to complete their tasks.

        <div class="detail_subtitle">What we learned about groups</div>
        <div class="detail_content">
          In relation to group a group work, we learnt that it can be difficult to work in one if the certain criteria and prerequisites are not set.
          Planning, setting deadlines and communication seem to be the key factors which attribute to successful group work. While we did not successfully adopt all
          these attributes, we did try and really improved from assignment 2 in terms of our communication and planning however we lacked in setting deadlines which really
          contradicted our planning. This is because planning is made redundant when the deadlines are not meant as it means we cannot progress until the work that is
          due is completed. This was not a major issue though as we did work on prototypes and frames separately however it is important to recognise this as it can be
          useful for future group work. We do believe however that this issue could be solved if groups pick a leader, or at least someone who will run things within the
          group, set deadlines and ensure the group is on track, as within our group we didn’t have a leader we mostly just got on calls and talked about what we were
          doing but we didn’t really lay down deadlines which a good leader would be able to do. An aspect of this leadership that would be even better is the idea of shared
           leadership in which members within the group are able to lead one another in an attempt to achieve the groups goals (Bligh, Pearce, Kohles, 2006), which would
            work greatly in group work as it could mean different members take leadership on sections in which they are the strongest at/ know the most about. We also realised
            that 6 members in a group while good due to the variety of ideas and differing skills can also be troublesome due to the variety of things that occur in each person’s life.
            These areas can impact the individual which in turn impacts the group, which is why we recognise that groups should have different plans in place so they can still progress
             if such an event occurs within the group. While some of our member had negative external factors influencing them, they still communicate very well and didn’t
             let it stop them from getting their allocated parts completed which they did so at a very high quality.
