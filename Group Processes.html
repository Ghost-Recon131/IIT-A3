              <div class="detail_content">During assignment 2 group started off well as we allocated all the tasks early one and had some days and times set for our recordings.
                 However, even though we had a fast and efficient start, it sorts of slowed down and we didn’t fully stick to our meeting times and days which hindered our group a bit.  We had some sections as individual work and we had partners set up for some of the big parts of the project. We also received a new member a towards the later stage of the project which was actually very beneficial as they added a lot of value to our group.
During the reflection for our second assignment, we realised that one thing that we should improve upon was to keep the pace constant in group 3, so we don’t have dips where the group doesn’t communicate or do any work. In assignment 3 we plan to communicate often and ensure that everyone is informed when something new is added or changed in the assignment. We have also decided to work on some parts in pairs or more rather than working on the same parts individually, this will prevent people from overlapping information or even contradicting each other’s paragraphs.
We also decided that once you finish your allocated sections and you have some time, you should try and help others in the group, as this is a group effort and things occur in everyone’s life that stops them from being the most effective and efficient at all times, hence members who are free and willing to help should do so, although it is not something that members necessarily need to do but it is something that all member would appreciate.
