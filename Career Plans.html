                  Comparing everyone’s plans in aiming for their ideal jobs, there are some common elements
                  that match with other members. The most common plan was to continue studying, usually
                  referring to courses in the university. While “Introduction to Information Technology”
                  is often a course taken by students enrolled in Bachelor of IT, it is also an optional
                  course that other members have chosen as an elective. Whatever course any member was in,
                  their job majorly involved IT, so everyone’s plan involved their studies in the university
                  as a core part of achieving their ideal jobs. Self-study also involves outside resources,
                  such as free courses on the internet that give experience in various areas of IT related
                  to their job.

                    Between all members, only one member had chosen to change their ideal job, opting for a position
                    that was in higher demand. Although some of the skills in their previous chosen job had changed,
                    some of the general skills matched their previous ideal job, resulting in minimal changes to the
                    skills required. Along with self-study and course studies, some members plan to apply for jobs
                    and/or
                    internships related to IT to gain experience in real-world scenarios. While general
                    skills such as communication and teamwork, which are vital in a job setting, are
                    common things that members wanted to work on, two members had specifically stated
                  how they were going to face their improvement on general skills. One member is using
                  the groups they work with in courses to practise leadership in teamwork scenarios,
                  along with utilising university activities to improve communication skills, while
                  another member plans to apply for public speaking classes to improve their general
                  communication skills to large groups of people, as their job focuses on the business
                  aspect of IT.

                  The ideal jobs that members aim for all correlate to the world of IT, resulting in
                  similar skills being required, such as experience in a specific field of IT, and the
                  ability to communicate effectively to clients and team members. 3 members had “Analyst”
                  in their position name, but had varying requirements, as they involved skills specific
                  to their job. One member had more general skills including “programming and scripting
                  knowledge”, while another member required an “understanding of frameworks”. A majority
                  of members required previous years of experience in their field for their ideal jobs,
                  but some members only required one year of experience, or just general knowledge in their
                  field for the position. Some members had goals that would specify the exact skills they
                   would need, such as direct qualifications or knowledge in a specific brand of IT like
                   “qualification in CBAP”, while few members had more general skills such as “problem
                   solving” and “understanding of software languages”.
